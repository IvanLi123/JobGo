Moving up from a starting level analyst level to senior manager might be pretty easy as it can happen as quickly as in 5 years. Moving up beyond that level is a little difficult as the opportunities slow down. If you are an external hire who joined directly as a manager / senior manager, you will have a tough time moving up to the director level since the current management gives preference to those who have been in the company in a variety of roles even though they may have less experience then you do. In a way, the company kind of ignores anything you did prior to joining Amex. In some departments, Canadian employees don't get promoted even if they are very qualified. They end up promoting someone in the US HQ and bringing them to Canada. This really affects the morale of the team. In recent years, there has been a lot of employee attrition as many employees got better opportunities with competitors like Scotia.
